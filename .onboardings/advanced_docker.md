# Advanced Docker

Learn how to use and build optimized Docker images and containers.

## 1. Image layers

Read the article about image layers to understand better how images are composed.

## 3. Multi-stage builds

Keep the layers as small as possible and make sure that each layer has the artifacts it needs from the previous layer and nothing else with multi-staged builds.
