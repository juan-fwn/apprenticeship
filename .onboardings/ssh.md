# SSH

Learn how SSH works on a basic level, configure SSH tunnels and authorization.


## 1. SSH overview

*Understand the uses of SSH*.

Read about:
- [ ] SSH overview

#### Resources
- [SSH Overview](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys#ssh-overview)


## 2. Creating a new SHH key pair

Create an SSH key pair, **if you don't have one already.**

*NOTE: It's recommended to create a 4096 bit RSA key as for now*

## 3. Familiarize with basic connection configuration

*Familiarize with basic SSH configuration options such as connecting to a different port and creating local aliases to remote hosts. Learn about* `~/.ssh/config` *file.*

## 5. SSH tunnels

*Learn about the power of SSH tunneling, or how to forward SSH connections to do fun stuff.*
*This is super useful when you want to access a localhost only interface remotely*
