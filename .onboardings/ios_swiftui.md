# iOS & SwiftUI

Throughout this training, you will be learning about the main things that are needed to develop native iOS applications using Swift and SwiftUI. You will not only focus on the frameworks and programming language, but also on the tools that are needed for development and several concepts that are key to understanding how this works.

You will first start with the industry standard course for iOS development that will teach you all the necessary aspects to start working on iOS apps. Here, you will watch several videos that teach you the essentials of Swift, SwiftUI and the iOS platform. This course also has several exercises for you to do through it.

Then, you will dive deeper into some more complex concepts to understand the inner workings of the platform and some 3rd party frameworks that are widely used in the field. This will include understanding several frameworks and general programming concepts. During this time, you’ll be creating a small project with a real API.

## 0. Before you start

As always, you'll need to do some setup on your computer before you start. Some will be necessary, while others will only be recommendations.

- [ ] [Package management](https://brew.sh/): This is a no-brainer. You should install Homebrew. It’s a package manager that will help you install everything you'll need. Its usage is dead simple and almost everything that you install in macOS will be available in it.

Tools you’ll need: after installing homebrew, you should use it to install the following tools that you’ll need 100% sure:

- [ ] Xcode: You’ll need to have Xcode installed. You can easily install it from the macOS AppStore. It’s pretty straightforward. Make sure you install Xcode first, since it comes with git and some other things bundled.

- [ ] [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)

Terminal:

It’s totally fine to use the default terminal (console), but there are other options that may suit you better.

[iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) is a fantastic option that provides a lot of customization points. If you are into further customizations, you can install [Oh my ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), but that’s completely optional

## 18. Architecture

In this section we are going to learn how to implement the MVVM design pattern in SwiftUI applications that are leveraging the Combine framework (for now let’s just ignore Combine, we will learn that later).

The combination of these 3 concepts will be the standard of iOS app architecture for the years to come, so it’s really important to set up a solid groundwork:

- [ ] [MVVM](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4161005-mvvm-with-combine-tutorial-for-ios)

Other iOS architecture patterns:

## 19. Advanced Swift

In the Stanford classes you made a small introduction to Swift, getting familiar with the syntax and how it works. The idea now is to get a deep dive into the language, learning all its powerful features and possibilities.

First, we’ll start with advanced syntax and functionalities provided by Swift. Using this will make your code more expressive and “swifty”. It’s always better to make full usage of the features of the language.

Linting & Code style:

As in any other language/platform/framework/etc, coding standards have the utmost importance in an iOS project. There’s several defined style guides, and several tools that enable us to enforce one of them.

## 20. Project: Task 1 - Onboarding

You will create a small application that will show you a list of movies, and you’ll be able to search and save your favorite ones. This will allow you to work in a kind-of-real application context. Discuss with your mentor which is the most appropriate architecture for this challenge. Remember to create the correspondent tests as you are developing the different features.

In this [figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A543) you’ll be able to see every screen, download the assets/images needed, and dimensions. Feel free to ask anyone in the design team if you have any doubts related.

You’ll be adding more advanced features as the onboarding process advances. For example, adding database management will be something added after you study it. Remember to always add tests to your pull requests. Create the tests as you are developing the feature

This task involves:

- [ ] The creation of the landing section (log in and Try Now buttons should be dummy)

- [ ] [Pricing Section](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A543)

- [ ] [Cancel Section](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A2)

- [ ] [Devices Section](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A478)

## 21. SwiftUI Concepts

Here, you’ll start learning some advanced features of the platform that you may have not seen during the Stanford course. This will allow you to develop more complex apps and adapt to the workflow used. First off, take a look at [SwiftUI Cheat Sheet](https://goshdarnswiftui.com/) and save it as a reference.

Data Flow Through SwiftUI:

Changing data in a SwiftUI view can make your UI update automatically. It almost seems like magic. But there’s no magic here, only a sleight of hand known as data flow.

Data flow is one of the key pillars of SwiftUI. Define your UI, give it some data to work with, and for the most part, it just works. Everything stays in sync, and there’s no risk of the UI ending up in a bad state due to changing data.

To effectively use SwiftUI, you need to understand the concept of data flow. Watch the following WWDC sessions (watch them slowly, and make sure to understand it correctly):

- [ ] [Data Flow Through SwiftUI (WWDC 19)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/226)

- [ ] [Data Essentials (WWDC 20)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10040)

View Life Cycle:

Each view undergoes a series of events from its birth to its death, which is referred to as a lifecycle. Understanding it is essential when building apps in SwiftUI:

- [ ] [The simple cycle of a SwiftUI View](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/the-simple-life-cycle-of-a-swiftui-view-95e2e14848a2)

The Layout System:

Frame
By default, SwiftUI calculates each view size based on the container that it’s rendered in, and will then center it within its parent. But there is a view modifier that allows us to tell our view to adopt a fixed or flexible size: .frame()

- [ ] [Frame Behaviors](https://swiftui-lab.com/frame-behaviors/)

Alignment
SwiftUI gives us a number of valuable ways of controlling the way views are aligned:

- [ ] [Alignment Guides](https://swiftui-lab.com/alignment-guides/)

Layout priorities
Layout priorities enable us to tell the SwiftUI layout system which views are the most (or least) important in terms of respecting their preferred sizes. Each view starts out with a layout priority of zero, which can then either be reduced or increased by applying the layoutPriority() modifier:

- [ ] [Layout Priorities](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2020/04/15/layout-priorities-in-swiftui/)

## 22. Project: Task 2 - Navigation

This task involves the navigation of the app. From the Login screen to the Home screen, including the bottom tab bar with an empty view for each tab. The Try Now button should navigate from the Landing screen to the Home screen

- [ ] Tab Home
- [ ] Tab Search
- [ ] Tab My List
- [ ] Tab Profile
- [ ] The Try Now button should navigate from the Landing screen to the Home screen

## 23. Package managers & Info.plist

Package managers:

Third-party libraries are awesome, they help us to increase productivity and avoid reinventing the wheel, but… with great libraries comes great responsibility.

Be sure to check whether libraries you're going to use are actively maintained and supported.
Be sure to check the license. We certainly must avoid using libraries that are not free for commercial use.

Having said that, when it comes to integrating third-party dependencies we have several options: Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods, Carthage, or by hand.

- [ ] [Managing your App’s Information Property List](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/managing_your_app_s_information_property_list)

## 24. Networking - URL Session

Networking and interacting with external services via http is a key part of any application that you will develop. There’s almost no application that does not communicate over the network.

Out of the box, Apple provides [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) as the way to make network calls.

- [ ] [URLSession tutorial](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/sending-and-receiving-codable-data-with-urlsession-and-swiftui) (must)

## 25. Project: Task 3 - Home

This task involves the creation of the [Home screen](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A53). In order to populate the ”Trending Now” and “Recently Added” lists, it will be required to fetch movies from a public api.
You will need to register a user in [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) , and get an API KEY.

You will need to show the first movie in the Trending Now list as the main movie:

- [ ] Display the poster movie as the background image of the screen
- [ ] Display the genres of the movie (1 minimum, 3 max)

When tapping on a movie from any list, it will be displayed as the main movie of the screen, refreshing the data accordingly.

The buttons Play, My List, Info should be dummy.
The list My List for now will be displayed empty

## 26. Networking - Alamofire

Sometimes, URLSession can get really cumbersome to make requests just with that. There’s a lot of low level configuration and messy parameters that have to be taken into account.

Furthermore, a lot of this configuration is mildly repetitive. Due to the mentioned reasons, the industry standard is to use [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), which is another layer built on top of URLSession that gets a lot of things ready for you out of the box.

- [ ] [Alamofire tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/35-alamofire-tutorial-getting-started) (must)

- [ ] [Integration with SwiftUI](https://betterprogramming.pub/combine-swiftui-with-alamofire-abb4cd4a0aca)

## 27. Project: Task 4 - Search

This task involves the creation of the [Search screen](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A86). Use [The Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) API to perform the search.
Don’t forget to include an empty state when there are no results for the search.

## 28. Reactive programming and Combine

We use reactive programming and Combine in particular in our applications. This allows us to simplify our code by taking the best of reactive programming. Here, you’ll learn what it is, and how to use Combine. It can look a bit strange at first, but believe us, you will love it once you see how it works and the things it brings to the table.

Getting Started (must)

- [ ] [RxSwift: Reactive Programming with Swift - Chapter 1](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/rxswift-reactive-programming-with-swift/v4.0/chapters/1-hello-rxswift)

You can play a bit using [RxMarbles](http://rxmarbles.com/) to see observables in action.

Hands-On with Combine:

So, by now you should have a somewhat clear understanding of how Reactive Programming works, but as we all know, practice is the best way of learning, so it's time to learn some Combine and start writing some code.

First, what the following WWDC talks:

- [ ] [Introducing Combine](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/722/)

- [ ] [Combine in Practice](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/721/)

Then read the official documentation:

- [ ] [Combine Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)

- [ ] [Receiving and Handling Events with Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/receiving-and-handling-events-with-combine)

After that, you should be good to go and start coding

- [ ] [Combine, getting started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/7864801-combine-getting-started) (must)

- [ ] [MVVM with Combine](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4161005-mvvm-with-combine-tutorial-for-ios) (must)

- [ ] [Understanding Combine Publishers and Subscribers](https://www.donnywals.com/understanding-combines-publishers-and-subscribers/) (must)

- [ ] [Intro to Combine with UIKit](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/combine/) (optional)

To learn even more about using Combine, you can check the following books:

- [ ] [Combine: Asynchronous Programming with Swift](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBqk-7atlco8UoE1yHKSFfjHCkGD8fDe/view?usp=sharing) (optional)

- [ ] [Using Combine](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/) (optional)

Feel free to read as much as you want and keep it as a reference!

## 29. Project: Task 5 - My List

This task involves the creation of the [My List screen](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A291) and the functionality of adding/removing from the list. For this, you will need to add functionality to the My List button in the Home screen: it will add/remove the main movie to the list.
Remember to change the My List button to an “+” or “-” icon according to the movie selected as main.

For now, let’s save the My List content in memory.

## 30. Database

Persistence is needed for any mobile application. It may be because it’s critical to work offline, because there’s a sync feature, or it’s just used as a cache. That’s why it’s necessary to understand how to save data.

Persisting data into the device can get really complex, really fast. iOS gives us the full potential of being able to have a fully fledged sqlite db. So we can define our domain models as needed, define migrations, relationships, etc. As you can see, this can get really complex, really fast.

Since we can’t go around changing our database engine after our app is on the store, it’s key that we make the correct decisions at the beginning of the project.

As of today, the two main frameworks that we can use are CoreData and Realm. On one hand, CoreData is the official framework from Apple, comes bundled with the OS, it has a ton of support and community around it and it’s built on top of SQLite.

On the other side, we have [Realm](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/), which is a custom database engine built for a lot of different platforms (Android, React Native, Backend and iOS) and has a few [advantages when comparing it to CoreData](https://www.rockersinfo.com/blog/realm-database-vs-coredata/).

- [ ] [Realm tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/12235561-realm-with-swiftui-tutorial-getting-started) (must)

## 31. Project: Task 6 - Offline Mode

In this task you will add a datastore to the app in order to allow an offline mode.
For this you will have to save every list and movie retrieved from the API to a local database. Then, when no internet connection is available, use the data from the database to enable the offline mode. This includes:

- [ ] My List (must)
- [ ] Trending Now (optional)
- [ ] Recently Added lists (optional)
- [ ] Search will perform the search using the database (optional)

## 32. SwiftUI 2.0+

With the introduction of the new iteration of the SwiftUI framework (SwiftUI 2.0, in WWDC 20), many new features were added. We’ve seen some of them in the previous sections, but most of them are still pending, let's catch up:

- [ ] [What’s new in SwiftUI](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2020/04/15/layout-priorities-in-swiftui/)

- [ ] [Mastering Grids](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2020/04/15/layout-priorities-in-swiftui/)

Animations:

Most of the apps you’ll see, do not just show static content. The best apps have animations, where things move, transform and appear in an organic way. In this section you’ll learn how to perform animations and transitions in an iOS app using SwiftUI.

- [ ] [Advanced Transitions](https://swiftui-lab.com/advanced-transitions/)

## 33. Deployment

After the entire development of an application, you’ll have to release it to the AppStore, there’s several steps necessary to do this. In this part, you'll learn how to do it. There are a lot of concepts involved, such as bundle identifiers, certificates that are required to assure security.
