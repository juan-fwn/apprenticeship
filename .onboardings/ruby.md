# Ruby

Learn about Ruby and apply it by doing a small project

## 1. Get in touch with Ruby

Follow this Ruby quick-start guide: [Ruby in Twenty Minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)

## 2. Install environment

- [ ] Install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
- [ ] Install latest Ruby version, using rbenv
- [ ] Install [bundler](https://bundler.io/)

## 3. Ruby Basics

- [ ] Follow [Basic Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby#basic-ruby) to learn about Ruby primitives, Ruby built-in methods, iterators and flow control


## 4. Ruby intermediate

Learn about:

- [ ] [Object Oriented Programming](
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/object-oriented-programming-ruby-programming)
- [ ] [Serialization and how to interact with files](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/files-and-serialization-ruby-programming)

## 5. Exercise - Part 1

Build a program that receives a filename and uploads the file as a gist into GitHub

Additionally, the script should:
- Print gist’s url when upload finishes
- If a connection error occurs, give the user an option to retry.

## 6. Exercise - Part 2

Modify the program you created in the previous step to allow receiving either a filename or a dirname.

If a dirname is provided all the files in the directory (including sub-directories) should be uploaded as part of the same gist.

--

*HINT: Github's gists do not have a "directory" or "folder" concept, so you will need to think on a way to represent that in the name of each gist file*

## 7. Testing Ruby

- [ ] Follow [Test Driven Development section](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/test-driven-development) to learn how to test what you build

- [ ] Follow [Introduction to RSpec](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/introduction-to-rspec) to learn how can you use it to test your code

## 8. Exercise - Part 3

Add code documentation and tests to the program your created in the previous Ruby exercise.

Use Yard for code documentation, and Rspec for writing tests.
