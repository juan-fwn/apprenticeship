# Python

Learn about Python 3 and apply that knowledge by doing some small projects

## 1. Getting started
​
Study the following readings from [The Python Tutorial @ docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).
​
- [ ] [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) _"succinctly channels the guiding principles for Python's design"_.
- [ ] [Installation](https://mooveit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STUD/pages/2217836545/Installing+Python) install Python, pyenv and poetry

## 2. IPython
[IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html), among other things, is an enhanced python interpreter with features that allow for better debugging and testing of our scripts and modules. Here we will cover some of its main’s features.
- [ ] [Install IPython](https://ipython.org/install.html).
- [ ] [Introduction](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html)
- [ ] [Embedding IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/reference.html#embedding). This is a very useful feature for debugging and testing.
- [ ] [Using the Python debugger](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).
- [ ] [Built-in magic commands](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html). Keep as reference.

## 3a. Python basics (1)
​
Study the following readings from [The Python Tutorial @ docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). Please try out the code examples in your computer as you go along.
​
- [ ] [An Informal Introduction to Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) explains how to operate with numbers, strings and lists in Python, using the interpreter as a calculator.
- [ ] [Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) details the border cases and limitations of floating point number representation.
- [ ] [More Control Flow Tools](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html) presents the syntax for conditional statements and loops, as well as function definition.
- [ ] [Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) expands on Python's lists and introduces other basic data structures (tuples, sets and dictionaries), its methods and operators, and the concept

## 3b. Python basics (2)
​
Study the following readings from [The Python Tutorial @ docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). Please try out the code examples in your computer as you go along.
​
- [ ] [Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) presents how Python code is organized in modules and packages.
- [ ] [Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) explains how to read and write from files with Python. Also check out:
  + [ ] [Templating](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#templating).
- [ ] [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) deals with how to catch, raise and define exceptions in Python.


## 4. Object oriented programming
​
Study the following readings from [The Python Tutorial @ docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). Please try out the code examples in your computer as you go along.
​
- [ ] [Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) explains syntax, semantics and quirks of Python object orientation. This includes:
  + [ ] [class syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-definition-syntax).
  + [ ] [objects](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects).
  + [ ] [inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance) .
  + [ ] [scopes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#scopes-and-namespaces-example) and [visibility](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables).
  + [ ] and also [iterators](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators) and [generators](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generators).

## 5. Code quality
​
- [ ] Check out and keep as a reference:  [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). It is the official word from our beloved [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) himself.
- [ ] Also read: [Code Style](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/). It is _The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python_ coding style, it has examples from the most common coding styles and conventions, always following PEP 8.
- [ ] Check out [Pylint](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/). Use the linter for future scripts.
- [ ] [Structuring Your Project](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/) deals with projects instead of single source files. The part about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) can be ignored for now.

## 6. Testing

Learn to code Unit Tests in Python using built-in module unittest.

- [ ] [Testing your code](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/) has an introduction to unit tests in general and an overview of test tools in Python.
- [ ] [An intro to unittest](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/) covers through examples some of the main features in unittest module. Study this reading and reproduce the examples.
- [ ] [unittest — Unit testing framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) is the official unittest documentation. Skim through it and keep it as a reference.

## 7. Further lectures


The following articles cover through examples some of the previous topics as well as a few new ones. These are good readings to follow and reproduce in order to gain more familiarity with the language.

- [ ] [Python's math module](https://realpython.com/python-math-module/). An introduction to the math module and an overview of its core features.
- [ ] [Python Interview Problem – Parsing CSV Files](https://realpython.com/python-interview-problem-parsing-csv-files/) is an interesting real-life example of Test Driven Development (TDD) using Python.
