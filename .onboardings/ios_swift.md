# iOS & Swift

Learn how to develop iOS apps using Swift by reading material, watching talks and developing a small movies application.

Throughout this training, you will be learning about the main things that are needed to develop native iOS applications. You will not only focus on the frameworks and programming language, but also on the tools that are needed for development and several concepts that are key to understanding how this works.

You will first start with the industry standard course for iOS development that will teach you all the necessary aspects to start working on iOS apps. Here, you will watch several videos that teach you the essentials of Swift, UIKit and the iOS platform. This course also has several exercises for you to do through it.

Then, you will dive deeper in some more complex concepts to understand the inner workings of the platform and some 3rd party frameworks that are widely used on the field. This will include understanding several frameworks and general programming concepts. During this time, you’ll be creating a small project with a real API

## 0. Before you start

As always, you'll need to do some setup on your computer before you start. Some will be necessary, while others will only be recommendations.

- [ ] [Package management](https://brew.sh/): This is a no-brainer. You should install Homebrew. It’s a package manager that will help you install everything you'll need. Its usage is dead simple and almost everything that you install in macOS will be available in it.

Tools you’ll need: after installing homebrew, you should use it to install the following tools that you’ll need 100% sure:

- [ ] Xcode: You’ll need to have Xcode installed. You can easily install it from the macOS AppStore. It’s pretty straightforward.  Make sure you install Xcode first, since it comes with git and some other things bundled.

- [ ] [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)

Terminal:

It’s totally fine to use the default terminal (console), but there are other options that may suit you better. 

[iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) is a fantastic option that provides a lot of customization points. If you are into further customizations, you can install [Oh my ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), but that’s completely optional

## 18. Advanced Swift

In the Stanford classes you made a small introduction to Swift, getting familiar with the syntax and how it works. The idea now is to get a deep dive into the language, learning all its powerful features and possibilities.

First, we’ll start with advanced syntax and functionalities provided by Swift. Using this will make your code more expressive and “swifty”. It’s always better to make full usage of the features of the language.

Linting & Code style:

As in any other language/platform/framework/etc, coding standards have the utmost importance in an iOS project. There’s several defined style guides, and several tools that enable us to enforce one of them.

## 19. Project: Task 1 - Onboarding

You will create a small application that will show you a list of movies, and you’ll be able to search and save your favorite ones. This will allow you to work in a kind-of-real application context. Discuss with your mentor which is the most appropriate architecture for this challenge. Remember to create the correspondent tests as you are developing the different features.

In this [figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A543) you’ll be able to see every screen, download the assets/images needed, and dimensions. Feel free to ask anyone in the design team if you have any doubts related. 

You’ll be adding more advanced features as the onboarding process advances. For example, adding database management will be something added after you study it. Remember to always add tests to your pull requests. Create the tests as you are developing the feature

This task involves:
- [ ] The creation of the landing section (log in and Try Now buttons should be dummy)

- [ ] [Pricing Section](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A543)

## 20. Advanced iOS

Here, you’ll start learning some advanced features of the platform that you may have not seen during the stanford course. This will allow you to develop more complex apps and adapt to the workflow used.

Programmatic UI:

As you have already seen on the Stanford course, there are two main ways to build UIs: Using the interface builder or doing everything programmatically. 

Most projects use a mix of both, they usually have at least some basic views defined using xibs or storyboard files and some specific stuff such as animations and dynamic behavior done in code. The truth is, as nice as the interface builder is, it brings a lot of problems that doing all your UI programmatically does not:

- Longer compile times. (xibs and storyboard files are always re-built in every build run).
- Maintainability issues such as font/colours/sizes definitions.
- No way to type check your navigation and keys (cell identifiers, segues, etc.)
- No clear picture of the true layout of your views, IB adds a lot of constraints and other things to the views that you initialize without telling you.
- No way to make your views completely independent from one another (segue initialization is a pain).

For those reasons (and some others) it’s important that you master views creation by code. At first, this can seem like a bit of a stretch, but most of the time it can make the difference in terms of efficiency, maintainability  and code quality.

The key to succeeding in building everything in code is to have a clear understanding of how autolayout works. It’s a really clever system with straightforward behaviour, so after you see how it works, it’s really easy to work with it. You should start by watching this WWDC talks:

- [ ] [Mysteries of Auto Layout p1](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/218)

- [ ] [Mysteries of Auto Layout p2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/219)

After that, you should read about what [UIWindow](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwindow) is so you can start to understand how to build all your navigation programmatically.

These are some complicated concepts, so there are several extra reads/watches that you can take in case you have the time/feel like you need them:

- [ ] [Easier autolayout coding](https://www.raywenderlich.com/1169-easier-auto-layout-coding-constraints-in-ios-9)

- [ ] [Swift 4: Introduction to Auto Layout Programmatically Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RydRg0ZKaI). These are an excellent series of videos that explain a lot of Autolayout by code. Sometimes it is better to see someone explaining it in a video.

Animations:

Most of the apps you’ll see do not just show static content. The best apps have animations, where things move, transform and appear in an organic way. In this section you’ll learn how to perform animations in an iOS app using Swift.

## 21. Project: Task 2 - Navigation

This task involves the navigation of the app. From the Login screen to the Home screen, including the bottom tab bar with an empty view for each tab. The Try Now button should navigate from the Landing screen to the Home screen
- [ ] Tab Home
- [ ] Tab Search
- [ ] Tab My List
- [ ] Tab Profile
- [ ] The Try Now button should navigate from the Landing screen to the Home screen

## 22. Networking

Networking and interacting with external services via http is a key part of any application that you will develop. There’s almost no application that does not communicate over the network.

Out of the box, Apple provides [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) as the way to make network calls. As you will see, it can get really cumbersome to make requests just with that. There’s a lot of low level configuration and messy parameters that have to be taken into account. 

Furthermore, a lot of this configuration is mildly repetitive. Due to the mentioned reasons, the industry standard is to use [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), which is another layer built on top of URLSession that gets a lot of things ready for you out of the box.

Finally, there’s another framework that builds on top of Alamofire which is called [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya). It provides a really thin layer of abstraction on top of Alamofire that helps with structuring your networking calls and services in a clear and concise way. Also, it provides a few helpers, such as RxSwift (more on rx later) integration.

## 23. Project: Task 3 - Home

This task involves the creation of the [Home screen](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A53). In order to populate the ”Trending Now” and “Recently Added” lists, it will be required to fetch movies from a public api.
You will need to register a user in [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) , and get an API KEY.

You will need to show the first movie in the Trending Now list as the main movie:
- [ ] Display the poster movie as the background image of the screen
- [ ] Display the genres of the movie (1 minimum, 3 max)

When tapping on a movie from any list, it will be displayed as the main movie of the screen, refreshing the data accordingly.

The buttons Play, My List, Info should be dummy.
The list My List for now will be displayed empty

## 24. Project: Task 4 - Search

This task involves the creation of the [Search screen](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A86). Use [The Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) API to perform the search.
Don’t forget to include an empty state when there are no results for the search.

## 25. Database

Persistence is needed for any mobile application. It may be because it’s critical to work offline, because there’s a sync feature, or it’s just used as a cache. That’s why it’s necessary to understand how to save data.

Persisting data into the device can get really complex, really fast. iOS gives us the full potential of being able to have a fully fledged sqlite db. So we can define our domain models as needed, define migrations, relationships, etc. As you can see, this can get really complex, really fast.

Since we can’t go around changing our database engine after our app is on the store, it’s key that we make the correct decisions at the beginning of the project.

As of today, the two main frameworks that we can use are CoreData and Realm. On one hand, CoreData is the official framework from Apple, comes bundled with the OS, it has a ton of support and community around it and it’s built on top of SQLite.

On the other side, we have [Realm](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/), which is a custom database engine built for a lot of different platforms (Android, React Native, Backend and iOS) and has a few [advantages when comparing it to CoreData](https://www.rockersinfo.com/blog/realm-database-vs-coredata/).

- [ ] [Realm tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/9220-realm-tutorial-getting-started)


## 26. Project: Task 5 - My List

This task involves the creation of the [My List screen](https://www.figma.com/file/gNP12kQqjDzSCyYmMiLu8F/Movy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A291) and the functionality of adding/removing from the list. For this, you will need to add functionality to the My List button in the Home screen: it will add/remove the main movie to the list.
Remember to change the My List button to an “+” or “-” icon according to the movie selected as main.

For now, let’s save the My List content in memory.

## 27. Project: Task 6 - Offline Mode

In this task you will add a datastore to the app in order to allow an offline mode.
For this you will have to save every list and movie retrieved from the API to a local database. Then, when no internet connection is available, use the data from the database to enable the offline mode. This includes:
- [ ] My List (must)
- [ ] Trending Now (optional)
- [ ] Recently Added lists (optional)
- [ ] Search will perform the search using the database (optional)

## 28. Deployment

After the entire development of an application, you’ll have to release it to the AppStore, there’s several steps necessary to do this. In this part, you'll learn how to do it. There are a lot of concepts involved, such as bundle identifiers, certificates that are required to assure security.
