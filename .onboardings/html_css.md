- [Dive into HTML5, what does it all mean?](https://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html)


## 2. HTML practice

*Apply what you just learned to solve some tasks*

- [ ] Create an HTML file that shows a list for your daily chores.

- [ ] Create another HTML file that has a table of your expenses.

- [ ] Create another HTML file. Now it should have a video, sound, and an image.

- [ ] Create a "sign up" form that includes:
    - Fields for: first name, last name, email, birthday
    - Dropdown to choose a favorite sport
    - Text-area to include a small bio
    - Button at the end to submit the form, and another one to clear the form
    - Relevant HTML validations for all fields (like required fields, valid email).

## 3. Event handling

*Learn how to react to events*

Learn about:

- [ ] What events are
- [ ] Listening to events
- [ ] Event bubbling

### Exercise

Play out with this [code snippet](https://codepen.io/snmgian/pen/BaRYPGE).

Observe that when the user clicks on the "Drop files here" area, the browser opens a system dialog for picking a file; but if the users clicks on the "Upload files" button the following issues occur:

- The page scrolls down to the footer
- The system dialog is opened twice

This exercise consists of:

- [ ] Test the code snippet in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, IE/Safari (depending on your OS)
      and verify that some of them behave a bit different
- [ ] Fix the issues using event handling techniques and test again in different browsers
