## 5. First coding task
(bold options must be defined by your mentor before start)
Create a **single | multi** module application.
Input:
```json
[{ 
  "id": uuid
  "category": common, uncommon, rare, epic or legendary
  "updateDate": timestamp in millis,
  "entries": uuid array
}]
```
Do the following 
 - Receive input **from an exposed api or pull from filesystem or an external api** in **json or xml** format    
 - Fetch a label for the entity from **an api, a database or filesystem**. Use id and category as key
 - Discard records if a label is missing, an id is invalid (not uuid), category is invalid, updateDate is older than the record stored if any or invalid entries
 - Store entities using **an api, a database or filesystem** using **async responses and/or batches**      
Support execution tracking for individual records using **logs or reports**
Support throttling. Be able to modify resource consumption
Apply **java#, spring #, aws, maven, ...** 
Create tasks before start
