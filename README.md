# Apprenticeship

### About

The apprenticeship is comprised of different modules designed to guide you on the path to be part of our developer's team.

You will have an assigned mentor to help you with the questions you may have, to give you feedback about your progress, and to transmit good practices.

### Initial steps

1. Fork this repository to use as a base for your future code.

2. Invite your mentor as collaborator in this new repository. You can do this under Settings -> Collaborators & Teams.

3. Ensure issues are enabled in your project. You can do this under in the Features section that's in Settings -> Options.

3. Install the [copy tool app](https://github.com/apps/project-copy-bot/) on this repo

4. Ask your mentor to setup the repository projects according to the onboarding plan devised for you. That plan is based on your background and previous working experience.

### Creating Pull Requests

1. Make sure your PR base branch is from your own apprenticeship repository and not `moove-it/apprenticeship`.

2. Add an informative title mentioning the onboarding project and exercise the PR is addressing.

3. In the description add a brief summary of the changes in the PR, screenshots are also welcome if UI is involved.

4. Assign your mentor as a reviewer of the PR and submit it. Let them know that your PR is ready for review through Slack.
